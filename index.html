    <p>
      Located only about 10 miles from Aspen, Colorado, the Maroon Bells are two
      14,000-foot peaks in the Elk Mountains that are reflected in crystal-clear
      Maroon Lake, snuggled in a glacial valley. They are the crown jewels of
      the Rocky Mountains and by far one of the most photographed scenes in the
      country. It is difficult to say when the timeless beauty of these two
      sentinels mirrored in the lake is more striking: In the summer, when every
      hiking trail takes you through fields of wild flowers, in the fall, when
      tall aspen trees dazzle with a rainbow of fall colors, or in the winter,
      when snow and ice silence the world. The best photo opportunities are from
      one of the many hiking trails – access by motor vehicles is limited. The
      lake is popular among fly-fishermen – even if they don’t catch anything,
      the beauty all around them is enough.

      <p>
        The Grand Canyon is a steep, 1-mile-deep, and up to 18-mile-wide gash in
        the fabric of the world, an immense gorge carved by the Colorado River
        over the last 5,000 years. Its sheer size is breathtaking and although
        you can see only a small portion of it even from the best vantage point,
        its geology and its age fire the imagination. The layers of colorful
        rock show the passage of time and some of the rocks at the bottom are
        1,8 billion years old. There is a lot of life growing on the canyon’s
        steep sides – you can see more of it hiking the trails of the northern
        rim, where it is also less crowded. Most people limit their visit to the
        breathtaking views from the southern rim. Some of the most popular
        viewpoints are Yavapai Observation Station, Mary Colter’s Lookout
        Studio, and Mather Point.

      <p>
        Located on top of a cliff with a spectacular view of the Palea volcano,
        Nea Kameni, and the island of Thirassia, Oia is the most popular and
        arguably the most beautiful of all the picturesque villages of the Greek
        island of Santorini. Only about 11 km from Fira, on the north of the
        island, Oia will charm you with its traditional stone houses lining the
        narrow streets, breathtaking blue-domed churches, and sunbaked verandas.
        While the village has its share of taverns, souvenir shops, and cafes,
        Oia is more quiet and laid-back than busy Fira and most people enjoy its
        quaint beauty by slowly exploring its narrow streets. Stroll through the
        village’s small port of Ammoudi by descending 300 steps down the cliff,
        or visit colorful galleries showcasing art from the many artists who
        fell in love with the village and made it their home. Oia, Santorini is
        considered by many one of the prettiest places in the world.

      <p>
        The Amalfi Coast is an extravagantly beautiful stretch of rugged coast
        in Campania, Italy, at the edge of the Sorrentine Peninsula. For about
        50 kilometers, the coast looks like something a romantic artist might
        have conjured – sheer cliffs plunging into the azure sea, tiny golden
        beaches hidden in secluded coves, pastel sun-washed villages hugging the
        steep slopes of Mount Ravello, and fragrant orange groves competing for
        attention with ancient vineyards. You can take a typical Mediterranean
        coastal road between the port of Salerno, famous Positano and Amalfi,
        and lovely Sorrento perched on the clifftop to enjoy the landscape in
        all its majesty, or you can take one of the many hiking trails that will
        take you past old villages, offer spectacular views, and introduce you
        to some fantastic quaint local restaurants and tavernas. If you are
        looking for famous places to visit around the world, Amalfi Coast is an
        amazing destination.

      <p>
        Located about halfway between the Croatian capital Zagreb and Zadar on
        the coast of the Adriatic Sea, Plitvice Lakes are a magical world of
        living, moving water surrounded by ancient forests, 16 lakes linked by
        waterfalls, bridges natural and man-made, and 300 square kilometers of
        wild beauty full of bears, wolves, boars, and birds. The difference in
        altitude between 1,280 meters at the highest point and 280 meters at the
        lowest creates a seemingly endless number of falls, big and small, that
        permanently fill the air with spray and fog. Wooden and natural walkways
        and hiking trails spin around and across the lake and a ferry on Lake
        Kozjak shuttles people between the upper and lower lakes. The lakes are
        beautiful all year round, but especially when mirroring magical fall
        colors or the lacy frozen branches of the surrounding trees.

      <p>
        The only living thing on Earth that can be seen from space, the Great
        Barrier Reef is immense. Located in northeastern Australia off the coast
        of Queensland, this 2,300-km-long complex ecosystem comprises more than
        3,000 individual reef systems, coral cays, and hundreds of islands, big
        and small, with sparkling white sandy beaches. While immensely beautiful
        on the surface, the true beauty of the reef is underwater, where there
        is a living world composed of more than 600 types of soft and hard
        coral, creating a colorful and mesmerizing home to endless numbers of
        species of tropical fish, sea stars, mollusks, turtles, sharks, and
        dolphins. This divers’ paradise can also be enjoyed snorkeling, in a
        glass-bottomed boat, sailing, from semi-submersibles, and just by plain
        swimming.

      <p>
        At the southern tip of the Andes in Chile’s Patagonia lies Torres del
        Paine National Park, a place with more than its fair share of nature’s
        majesty: It has soaring mountains, cold blue icebergs cleaving from
        ancient glaciers, bottomless lakes, spectacular geological formations,
        narrow fjords, deep rivers, ancient forests, and endless golden pampas
        covered with wild flowers and providing home to such rare wildlife as
        pumas and the llama-like guanacos. The best way to see Torres del Paine
        is on foot following one of many famous tracks, but if you have to limit
        yourself to just a few iconic sites, visit the three majestic granite
        towers, or torres del paine, Los Cuernos, Grey Glacier, and French
        Valley.

      <p>
        Located in the remote Valley of the Ten Peaks in the Canadian Rockies,
        Moraine Lake is an emerald beauty, a small, cold glacier-fed jewel
        surrounded by towering mountains, immense waterfalls, and ancient rock
        piles, so beautiful it takes breath away. As the glaciers melt, the
        water in the lake rises and changes its color. It might take away some
        of its magic to know that the color is affected by the sediment brought
        by the glacial waters. The whole area is crossed by scenic hiking trails
        that offer different perspectives of the lake depending on your
        elevation or location. You can also enjoy its beauty from a kayak or
        canoe, or just by sitting on a rock at its bank. Take it all in, no
        photograph will ever give it justice.

      <p>
        Mauna Kea Beach is stunningly beautiful golden sand beach, one of the
        most beautiful of all the great beaches on the Big Island of Hawaii.
        Long and wide, the beach is fabulous for long walks but is even better
        for swimming as the sand slowly slopes out into the water, so entering
        it is easy even for children or beginners. You can keep wading for quite
        a while until you reach waist-deep water. Snorkeling is also popular,
        but only at the two extreme beach ends where the beach is guarded by
        natural rock promontories. Because the beach is connected to the Mauna
        Kea Beach Hotel, it is never crowded, although parking is limited.

        Victoria Falls, aptly named Mosi-oa-Tunya – the Smoke that Thunders – by
        locals is a breathtaking spectacle of incomparable beauty and majesty.
        The largest water curtain in the world, this enormous waterfall on the
        Zambezi River on the border between Zambia and Zimbabwe can be heard
        from 40 kilometers away, as the waters of the normally placid Zambezi
        river plummet over the edge of the wide basalt cliff into the
        magnificent gorge 100 meters below. The spray of the water can be seen
        from 50 km away as it rises 400 meters in the air, creating permanent
        clouds and endless rainbows. Across the falls is a basalt wall of the
        same height covered with dense jungle, offering magnificent views of the
        main falls and the number of continuous falls as the water zigzags
        through the series of gorges.
